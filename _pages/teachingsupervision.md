I have been very fortunate to work with the following remarkable students:

# PhD Supervision (University of Liverpool)
- **Hadi Beyzaee**, _Failure and recovery of robotic chemists for computationally-guided materials discovery_, Co-advised with Prof. Andy Cooper.

# Summer Internship Supervision (University of Liverpool)

- **Yixin Cai**, _Vision-guided Robotic Manipulation for Error Correction in a Materials Discovery Laboratory_, Summer Research Internship, 2021 (Co-advised with Prof. Andy Cooper).

- **Hetong Wang**, _Robot Skill Learning for Chemistry Labs_, Summer Research Internship, 2022 (Co-advised with Prof. Andy Cooper).

# Thesis Supervision (University of Edinburgh)

- **David Jorge**, _Online Inverse Dynamics Learning Using Sparse Gaussian Processes_, MInf, 2020-2022 (Co-advised with Prof. Michael Mistry).

- **Guangyu Yang**, _Inverse Dynamics Model Learning Using Neural Networks_, MSc, 2019-2020 (Co-advised with Prof. Michael Mistry).

# Teaching

I am module leader for the following modules in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool:

- CSCK505: Robotics (online)
- CSCK501: Global Trends in Computer Science (online)

_I am always looking to work with and help underrepresented groups in STEM fields, particularly in the field of robotics (robot learning, manipulation, robot vision) for real-world applications, primarily in Chemistry/material discovery laboratories; please email me directly if you would like to work on projects in our Autonomous Robotic Chemistry Lab or you are trying to find a project related to the ones I have previously supervised._
