I am a researcher in robot learning and (from Sep 2023) Lecturer in Robotics and Chemistry Automation at the University of Liverpool. With my group, I am very excited to develop methods towards creating the next generation of robotic scientists for accelerating material discovery. 

# Research Interests

My research interests lie within the intersection of **robotics** and **machine learning**, with a particular focus on intelligent robotic manipulation for laboratory environments. I am broadly interested in the following topics: 

* contact-based robot skill learning
* failure recovery methods in laboratory environments
* safe human-robot collaboration 
* machine vision for laboratory environments
* statistical learning for dynamical and control systems
* physics-constrained learning

Moreover, I am passionate about deploying algorithms to control the dynamic behaviour of robots with the goal of moving closer to robots that can adapt in real-world environments.
