------

Currently, I work within the [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) and the [Edinburgh Centre for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate.

Prior to this, I was a Marie-Sklodowska Curie early stage researcher within the [Cognitive Robotics Lab](https://corolab.github.io/) and obtained my Ph.D. from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My work focused on improving the iCub's language acquisition through perception.

During my Ph.D., I have also carried out research secondments at the University of Edinburgh [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) and at the [Humanoid Sensing and Perception Research Lab](https://www.iit.it/research/lines/humanoid-sensing-and-perception) within the iCub facility at IIT.

# Research Interests

My research interests lie within the intersection of **robot learning** and **control**, focusing on generalisation and safe human-robot collaboration. I am broadly interested in the following topics: 

* statistical learning for dynamical and control systems
* physics-constrained learning
* bridging model-based and learning-based dynamical and control systems
* safe human-robot collaboration 

Moreover, I am passionate about deploying algorithms to control the dynamic behaviour of robots with the goal of moving closer to robots that can adapt in real-world environments.
