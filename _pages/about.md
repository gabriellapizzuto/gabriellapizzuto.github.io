My research interests lie within the intersection of **robot learning** and **control**, focusing on generalisation and lifelong learning. I am broadly interested in the following topics: statistical learning for dynamical and control systems, physics-constrained learning, bridging model-based and learning-based dynamical and control systems and system identification. Moreover, I am passionate about deploying algorithms to control the dynamic behaviour of robots with the goal of moving closer to robots that can adapt in real-world environments.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral research associate in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Prior to joining the Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour (IPAB) and the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics (ECR), she had been an early stage researcher within the Marie-Sklodowska Curie Action educational training network, [DCOMM](http://www.dcomm.eu/), and obtained her PhD from the University of Manchester. During her PhD, she was part of the machine learning and optimisation research group and the cognitive robotics lab under the supervision of Prof. Angelo Cangelosi, working on improving the iCub's language acquisition through perception.  She has previously obtained her Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics at the University of Birmingham, where she worked mostly on model learning and control applied to robotic manipulators, and graduated as an electrical engineer from the University of Malta, specialising in control and electronics.
