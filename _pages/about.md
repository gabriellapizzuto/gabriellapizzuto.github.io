My research interests lie within the intersection of **robot learning** and **control**, focusing on generalisation and lifelong learning. I am broadly interested in the following topics: statistical learning for dynamical and control systems, physics-constrained learning, bridging model-based and learning-based dynamical and control systems and system identification. Moreover, I am passionate about deploying algorithms to control the dynamic behaviour of robots with the goal of moving closer to robots that can adapt in real-world environments.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). Prior to joining the [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) and the [Edinburgh Centre for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/), I was an early stage researcher within the Marie-Sklodowska Curie Action educational training network, [DCOMM](http://www.dcomm.eu/), and obtained my Ph.D. from the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). During my Ph.D., I was part of the [machine learning and robotics research group](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/machine-learning-and-robotics/) and the [cognitive robotics lab](https://corolab.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Angelo Cangelosi](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/angelo.cangelosi.html), working on improving the iCub's language acquisition through perception.  I have previously obtained my Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Robotics at the University of Birmingham, where I worked mostly on model learning and control applied to robotic manipulators, and graduated as an electrical engineer from the University of Malta, specialising in control and electronics.
