_I am always looking to work with and help underrepresented groups in STEM fields, particularly in the field of robotics (robot learning, manipulation, robot vision) for real-world applications, primarily in Chemistry/material discovery laboratories; please email me directly if you would like to work on projects in our Autonomous Robotic Chemistry Lab or you are trying to find a project related to the ones I have previously supervised._
