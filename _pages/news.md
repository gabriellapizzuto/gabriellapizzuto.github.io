|Successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis! Will miss this little guy. :)|![](/images/icub.jpg){:height="300px" width="150px"}|

2019
------

|I have joined the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics as a postdoctoral research associate working under Michael Mistry. Looking forward to working again with this group and to implement more generalisable and efficient learning methods for robot control.|![](/images/edinpostdoc.jpg){:height="450px" width="250px"}|

|Officially submitted my Ph.D. thesis. Three years of working on deep learning methods to improve the iCub humanoid robot. |![](/images/gabicub.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|Presented our work on "Modelling the Single to Multi Word Transition Using Matrix Completion" at [IEEE ICDL-EPIROB](https://icdl-epirob2019.org/) 2019.|![](/images/icdl2019.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|Presented our work on "Exploring Deep Models for Comprehension of Deictic Gesture-Word Combinations in Cognitive Robotics" at [IJCNN](https://www.ijcnn.org/) 2019.|![](/images/ijcnn2019.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|A beautiful end to three years of fruitful collaborations and stimulating discussions as a Marie-Sklodowska Curie early stage researcher within DCOMM.|![](/images/dcommfinal.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|Presented our work "On the Use of Deep Models for Gesture-Word
Understanding in Developmental Robotics" at the [Deictic Communication - Theory and Application Conference](http://www.dcomm.eu/dcomm-conference/).|![](/images/dcommfinalconf.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|My last DCOMM secondment will be at the Italian Institute of Technology, working under Vadim Tikhanoff's supervision.|![](/images/iitsecondment.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

2018
------

|My first DCOMM secondment will be at the University of Edinburgh, working under Timothy Hospedales' supervision.|![](/images/edinplacement.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|Officially transferred to the University of Manchester, where I will be working as part of the newly formed [Cognitive Robotics Lab ](http://corolab.github.io).|![](/images/uom.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

2017
------

|DCOMM has officially passed the EU commission's mid-term review.|![](/images/dcommmidterm.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|

|At the UK robotics week organised at the University of Plymouth.|![](/images/ukroboticsweek.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"} |

|Presented our work on "Compositionality via gestures in robot language learning" during the first DCOMM conference [Language as a form of action](http://www.dcomm.eu/events/conference-rome-june-2017/).|![](/images/dcommrome2017.jpg){:height="400px" width="200px"}|
