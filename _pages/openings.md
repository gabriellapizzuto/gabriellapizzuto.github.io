Thank you for showing interest in working with me! :) I am always open to having researchers, who are excited about deploying robots in real-world Chemistry laboratories, join my group as PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, visitors or summer interns.

## PhD Openings

I have a fully funded [PhD studentship](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/studentships/a-reliable-and-reconfigurable-robot-learning-framework-for-accelerating-materials-discovery/) within the [CDT for Digital and Automated Materials Chemistry](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/digital-and-automated-materials-chemistry/), starting in 2025. If you want to help us transform how robotic chemists are designing, developed and deployed in human-centric labs, this position is for you! Please send an email with the subject [Prospective PhD CDT Student] if you would like further information. Official applications will only be processed if submitted through the University portal and I would encourage you to include a short CV, cover letter including your motivation for applying and your experience with robotics, machine learning, programming (C++, Python) and specifically why you are interested in working with me and my group and why you would like to be a part of the CDT.

## Postdocs

Currently, I do not have funding for postdoc positions. However, feel free to contact me if you are still interested in joining my lab and I would be happy to support you in obtaining external funding through the following schemes: [Marie Sklodowska Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), Royal Academy of Engineering Fellowships e.g. [RAEng IC Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://raeng.org.uk/programmes-and-prizes/programmes/uk-grants-and-prizes/support-for-research/uk-ic-postdoctoral-research-fellowships), and other similar schemes [here](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/researcher/fellowships/opportunities/). Please include a CV and a research statement describing you previous work and future plans.

## Undergraduate Students

I have several opportunities for undergraduate students to join my group:

- For UoL CS students, I supervise and offer projects in COMP390.
- For UK-based students, I offer summer internship projects through the Google Deepmind Research Ready Programme. Please contact me with the subject [Prospective UG Summer Internship],  including a short CV, cover letter including your motivation for applying and your experience with robotics, machine learning, programming (C++, Python) and specifically why you are interested in working with me and my group.
- For international students, I offer projects through the [Summer Research Programme](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/global-opportunities/inbound/summer-research-programme/projects/).

## Application Tips

- I highly value interpersonal skills in my students.
- I value intellectual curiosity and students who have an inquisitive nature.
- My research and group is highly interdisciplinary; hence, I value and will support students who have various backgrounds.
- I am particularly excited to work with students who are enthusiastic in deploying algorithms on real-world robots and who share the same passion for robotics as I do :)
